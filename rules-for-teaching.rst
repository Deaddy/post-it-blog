# rules for teaching

In some sense, it is a lot like coding.
Or writing.
Or any other communication with human, but being a teacher means you are in a
special position of power and responsibility.

- do not teach if you are stupid
- do not use ex post simplifications instead of the real thing
- make switches between abstraction layers clear and try to switch not too
  often
- be clear when you leave things out or treat them as black box
- never wash up your own mistakes, but make them painfully obvious
- make sure to map out the course and make clear, what the end goal will be or
  if it will be more of an exploratory journey or if there will be a stretch
  of a lot of boilerplate things you just need to get through
