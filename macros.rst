Assuming you lift:

- 2g protein per kg of target bodyweight
- 1g fat per kg of target bodyweight
- remaining calories carbs

If you don't lift 1.5g protein per kg of bodyweight.

If your target bodyweight is far above your current BW, say >10%, it is
sensible to split the journey into more managable chunks <5%.
