# post-it-blog

Snippets of things too short for blog posts, i.e. everything here:

- fits on a small slip of a paper
- is useful in itself
- does not provide reasoning for anything on the notes

If I already have a long-form post on the topic I will provide a link.
I might also link other people. If I don't have provided any explanation but
you are interested, github probably gives you means to contact me about this,
I then might write a post about it.
