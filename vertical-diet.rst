Main goals:
- eat lots of food to fuel training
- eat progressively more food to fuel more training

Contains:
- meat as main protein source
- an easily digestible carb source
- some broth to mix in
- vegetables and juices selected such that you can eat much of it but it does
  not give you digestive trouble

Selection of foods usually boils down to ground meat, rice and vegetables low
on the FODMAP, but YMMV.
